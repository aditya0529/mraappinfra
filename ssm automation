This pattern automates stop/start operations on your ECS services by decoupling runbook generation from execution:

Triggering the Pipeline

On-demand: A user manually kicks off the workflow.

Event-driven: An EventBridge rule detects when a new ECS service is tagged (e.g. with a “ManageViaSSM” tag) and fires.

Runbook Generation

EventBridge invokes a Lambda (ECS Automation) function.

The Lambda reads your tag/configuration, then creates or updates one or more AWS Systems Manager Automation Documents (runbooks) that encapsulate the ECS API calls needed to stop or start tasks.

Automation Execution

Operators (or additional automation) execute these SSM runbooks—either via the console, CLI, or as part of a multi-account/region SSM Automation.

The runbook’s steps call into ECS APIs to stop or start tasks on the specified services within your ECS Cluster.

Key Benefits

Dynamic Runbooks: New services automatically get a tailored stop/start document whenever they’re tagged or when you redeploy.

Separation of Concerns: Runbook creation (Lambda) is distinct from runbook execution (SSM), making it easy to audit, version, and grant least-privilege.

Scalable & Repeatable: You can trigger automations across accounts and regions via SSM’s multi-account Automation features.

Auditable: All SSM executions are logged in AWS CloudTrail and visible in the Systems Manager console.
